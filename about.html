  <h1>About me!</h1>
   <p>Hello! I'm Vincent Stanford, and I like computers. My focus is mostly on digital security and related practices and fields. I'm currently working to learn as much as I can and intend to use this site as a location to document my learning as well as any projects I may decide to build. Hopefully if you stumble upon this site, you will find something useful here.</p>
   <p>Some fun facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>I am working towards my masters degree in cybersecurity</li>
     <li>I have a wonderful orange cat named P2</li>
     <li>I am trying to build this website and all content in it myself from scratch.</li>
    </ul>
